    <h1>Chess Royal</h1>
    <p>Chess has its origins in ancient India, where it was known as <strong>Chaturanga</strong>. This early form of chess emerged around the 6th century AD and was played on an 8x8 board.</p>
    <p>The name "Chaturanga" means "four divisions of the military," referring to the infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots, which evolved into the modern chess pieces: pawn, knight, bishop, and rook.</p>
    <p>The game spread to Persia, where it became known as <em>Shatranj</em>, and later reached Europe, evolving into modern chess.</p>
    <p>Chess was highly regarded in medieval courts and was often used as a strategic tool to teach military tactics.</p>
    <p>During the Renaissance, chess evolved further with new rules, such as the powerful movement of the queen and the standardization of the game board.</p>
    <p>By the 19th century, chess clubs and competitive tournaments became popular, leading to the establishment of formal chess organizations.</p>
    <p>The first official World Chess Championship took place in 1886, marking a new era of professional chess.</p>
    <p>In the 20th century, advancements in chess theory and the rise of grandmasters contributed to the game's global popularity.</p>
    <p>Computers revolutionized chess with AI-driven analysis, culminating in IBM's Deep Blue defeating Garry Kasparov in 1997.</p>
    <p>Online chess platforms have further increased the accessibility and reach of the game, allowing players worldwide to compete in real-time.</p>
    <p>Today, chess continues to thrive as an intellectual sport, blending historical traditions with modern technology.</p>
